**Keywords**: `Mali` `Tuareg` `Salt Mines` `Security problems`

> It had been said that no outsider would ever see the legendary salt mines of Mali and live to describe them; ever slip into the Caravan of White Gold, evade the slaughtering bandits, suffer the killing storms, and lay eyes upon the nightmarish landscape of 1,000 pits gouged by hand from the Saharan plain. Phooey.

* An Italian — I don’t recall which one — was standing over my sleeping bag and nudging my foot with his. “Some bandits have followed us up from Kidal.  “Muhammad said they came from Kidal. ” Muhammad, our recently hired security consultant, was a Tuareg himself.

**Keyword**: `Cru Sauvage` `Bolivian Amazon` `Río Grande` `Cacao`
> Jacobsen is writer who specializes in food and ecology and the effects they have on each other. He attempts humor at points in this reading. He also makes cultural references to such as Joseph Conrad (in the title and in text) and popular culture (Big Lebowski)

-   The impeccable Swiss packaging alluded to its aboriginal provenance, and inside were two bars wrapped in golden foil, 68 percent cacao.
-   He was planning a trip to Bolivia’s Río Grande, a remote tributary of the Amazon that, it was said, held vast chocolatales, as the forests of wild cacao are called.


## This Teeming Ark
BY TIM CAHILL, Outside magazine, June 1999

**Keywords**: `Congo River` `Flueve Congo` `God` `barge`
> It was like trying to drink a beer on the subway at rush hour. Jostled from all sides, I stood hard against the flimsy railing of a makeshift stall and tried to hold my place against various swirling currents of humanity.

- It was my tenth excruciating day aboard the Flueve Congo—a conglomeration of eight flatbed barges cabled to a great throbbing riverboat motoring down the Congo River. During the endless hours on deck, I had discovered that only drunkards were intelligent enough to comprehend my 100-word French vocabulary.

## The Place to Disappear
BY SUSAN ORLEAN, The New Yorker, January 7, 2000

**Keywords**: `Bangkok` , `Khao San Road`, `Guest House`, `Internet`
> This could be called travel writing about travelers. It covers a time that is undoubtably changed. If you ever heard of the novel _The Beach_ by Alex Garland or the film based on it starring Leonardo Di Caprio, this similar in the people she is talking about. 
> It is also about what some have theorized as a nonplace.

-   When you visit Khao San Road, you can bring back Indian undershirts decorated with Hindu imagery, Australian Billabong sweats, Nike jackets made in Indonesia, rubber-platform faux-fur thongs from another planet, Game Boys from Japan, and a used copy of "Memoirs of a Geisha" that was published in England and sold to a secondhand bookstore in Bangkok by a New Zealander on his way to Vietnam.
-   Seeing her again was both a shock and not a shock, because Khao San is so transitory a place that you imagine each encounter there to be singular, but then you realize that the world is small and this particular world of young adventurers is smaller yet, and that there is nothing extraordinary about seeing the same people, because their great adventures tend to take them to the same few places over and over again.

## The Ghost Road
By MARK JENKINS, Outside Magazine, Oct 1, 2003

**Keywords**: `Arunachal Pradesh` `India` `Kachins`  `Burma` `the Stilwell Road`
> Down dark passageways, right at one corner, left at the next, no idea where I’m going. On a main street in the town of Namsai, I spot three armed Arunachal Pradesh border policemen up ahead. It is the spring of 1996, and I’m traveling in this northeastern Indian state illegally. I slide into the flow of tasseled trishaws, pedestrians, clicking bicycles.
- By the time the United States entered the Second World War, Imperial Japan had been penetrating ever deeper into China for more than a decade, gaining control of nearly one-third of that weakened giant. In the first five months of 1942, Japanese forces rapidly subjugated much of Southeast Asia: the Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and a large swath of Burma. If China fell, all of Asia was threatened, from the rice fields of India to the oil fields of Baghdad.

## Long Day's Journey
BY ELIZABETH GILBERT, June 30, 2009

**Keywords**: `France` `Grande Randonnée` `baguettes`  `cheese`
> If you really want to experience a place, see it on foot. That’s how Elizabeth Gilbert spent two weeks, walking across Provence (come on, it’s only ten miles a day), eating like a local (duck liver and stinky cheeses), and drinking (and drinking) her way to the vacation of a lifetime
-  Now, I don't know about you, but when I walk into a town and learn that its greatest hero is the father of truffle culture, I feel that this portends very good things, foodwise.
-  There we stayed, eating and drinking away our last two days in France, before we would have to head back to the Paris airport and board American Airlines again…at which point, we would be obliged to surrender our cheese knife and our corkscrew, in the interests of national security.
